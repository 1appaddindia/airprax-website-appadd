        quality: "Exceptional oxygen quality",
        qualityDescription: "Our systems typically consist of one or two independent oxygen generation lines, a bank of cylinders and a high pressure booster, offering a back-up supply in case an individual component fails.",
        monitoring: "Sophisticated monitoring",
        monitoringDescription: "Each generator is individually controlled and equipped with an inlet dewpoint sensor, outlet flow meter and oxygen analyzer. All critical parameters are shown on the controller’s high resolution graphical display.",
