        question: "Are nitrogen generators safe?",
        answer: "Yes. As the generator does not add or take anything away from the atmospheric air, you could have one running in a closed room with no change to the overall content of the atmosphere. They also negate the need to store and move potentially dangerous high pressure cylinders on site."
    },
    {
        id: 2,
        question: "Why don't more companies have generators?",
        answer: "Traditionally, on-site gas generators were only economically viable in very large applications. With constant development, today's high efficiency products ensure that generators are economically viable for the smallest of applications, and an ever increasing number of companies are moving to generate their own nitrogen and oxygen."

        question: "Can Atlas Copco supply and install a complete on-site gas generation system with compressed air supply?",
        answer: "Yes, Atlas Copco Compressors can handle everything from air intake to pipework. Please check our typical installation for more information."
    },
    {
        id: 4,
        question: "How often should we change the oil?",
        answer: "In a rotary screw compressor, oil should be changed about every 7000-8000 hours. This depends on the type of compressor you purchase. For a Reciprocating air compressor, generally you would change the oil approximately every 3 months. For a more accurate time frame, call in with a model number to find the recommended schedule for your compressor."
    },
    {
        id: 5,
        question: "When should I replace the air intake filter?",
        answer: "If your compressor has an Air Intake Filter, it should be cleaned on a weekly basis (assuming you are using the compressor about 3 days a week). When the filter starts to develop debris that is becoming harder to clean out, or you notice any tears or holes in the filter, the filter should be replaced."
