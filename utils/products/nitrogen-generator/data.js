    content: ["Bottled Nitrogen is History. On-Site Nitrogen is the Future. If your business is a regular consumer of nitrogen, you’re likely (and perhaps even painfully) aware of what a hassle nitrogen-tank rental and delivery can present. Those bulky nitrogen cylinders take up a lot of floor space in your facility, and being such heavy vessels containing gas under high pressure, they amount to an ever-present safety risk. Further, the rental/delivery service can be very expensive, tank replacement regularly leads to downtime and added labor costs, the gas company’s strict contracts can be a challenge to get out of … and the list goes on. If any of the issues mentioned above sound familiar to you, you’re not alone. Like many business owners and workers in similar situations, it may be time for you to consider on-site nitrogen generation. The good news about generating on-site nitrogen is that if you already have an air compressor, you’re halfway there. All you need is a connected nitrogen generator unit to generate your own in-house nitrogen!", "Some applications don’t require a machine, but a solution. For those applications that need high-purity nitrogen at high pressures, like laser cutting, Atlas Copco has a nitrogen skid available. The 300 bar version is also suitable to fill your own bottles.Atlas Copco offers a breadth of nitrogen generators that will allow you to generate nitrogen at your own facility - and at whatever purity level your application requires.
