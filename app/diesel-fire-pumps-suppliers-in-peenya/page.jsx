              Why Choose a Diesel Fire Pump in Peenya
            </h1>
            <p className="text-black lg:text-base text-sm text-justify">
              In industrial hubs like Peenya, where continuous power supply
              cannot always be guaranteed, a diesel-engine driven fire pump
              becomes a critical component of your fire-protection system.
              Unlike electric-motor versions, a diesel fire pump can operate
              even during power failures—which is essential when responding to
              emergencies.

              Key Advantages
            </h2>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
              <li>
                Reliable during outage: Diesel driven fire pumps keep your
                fire-fighting system operational even when mains power fails.
              </li>
              <li>
                High flow & pressure: They deliver the high water volume and
                pressure needed for large-scale industrial or multi-storey
                commercial installations.
              </li>
              <li>
                Compliance & safety: With growing regulatory requirements for
                fire safety, choosing an appropriately certified diesel fire
                pump helps ensure your installation meets standards.
              </li>
              <li>
                Local support in Peenya: Being based in the Peenya industrial
                area means faster service, installation and after-sales support.

              How to Select the Right Diesel Fire Pump
            </h2>
            <p className="text-black lg:text-base text-sm">
              Selecting the correct diesel fire pump involves more than picking
              a model. Here are some factors to consider:
            </p>
            <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-1">
              <li>
                Flow & Pressure requirements – Determine the water demand of
                your fire-fighting system (hydrants/sprinklers) and ensure the
                pump can meet that head & capacity.
              </li>
              <li>
                Duty & standby configuration – Many installations require both a
                main pump and a standby pump for redundancy.
              </li>
              <li>
                Package & accessories – Does the set include fuel tank, control
                panel, auto-start unit, base frame, acoustic enclosure?
              </li>
              <li>
                Engine quality & fuel consumption – Diesel engines need to be
                reliable, easy to service, and fuel efficient.
              </li>
              <li>
                Service & maintenance support in Peenya – Proximity is vital for
                timely inspection, testing and spare parts.
              </li>
              <li>
                Compliance with codes – Ensure the pump set meets local
                fire-safety codes, IS standards and is tuned for your
                installation.
              </li>
