              driven or electric motor driven models, skid-mounted or
              trolley-mounted units. These are ideal when fixed fire pump

              How to Choose the Right Portable Fire Pump
            </h2>
            <p className="text-black lg:text-base text-sm text-justify">
              Selecting the correct portable fire pump for your facility in
              Peenya involves several criteria:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
              <li>
                Flow rate & head – Determine the required water volume (litres
                per minute) and delivery head (meters) based on your hazard zone
                and fire‐water demand.
              </li>
              <li>
                Power supply – Do you have reliable electricity onsite? Or is
                diesel engine driven pump more appropriate?
              </li>
              <li>
                Mobility vs stationary – Do you need a permanently installed
                portable pump (for occasional use) or a fully mobile trolley
                unit?
              </li>
              <li>
                Compatibility with existing system – Ensure the portable pump
                integrates with your hydrants, hoses, standpipes or sprinkler
                network.
              </li>
              <li>
                Regulatory & site compliance – For units in Peenya and
                Bangalore, ensure lifting capacity, manufacturing quality,
                certification and maintenance adhere to local fire‐safety norms.
              </li>
              <li>
                Service & spare-parts availability – Choosing a supplier in
                Peenya close to you means quicker access to service, parts and
                support when needed.
